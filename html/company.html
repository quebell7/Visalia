    <div id="about-us"><p class="lead-paragraph">Visalia Dairy Company was founded in 2015 on the principle of providing top quality, fresh dairy products for wholesale, retail and co-packing services. We are conveniently located in the heart of California’s Central Valley in Tulare County. Visalia Dairy Company has partnered with the Visalia Unified School District to create an internationally recognized certificate program administered by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) to encourage local students to successfully enter the dairy industry. </p>

    <p class="lead-paragraph">With the team we have in place here at Visalia Dairy Company, we are confident we can provide our customers with the leading experts in industry, overall quality products and above and beyond customer experience.</p>

    <p class="top-pad lead-paragraph">Visalia Dairy company is unique in the sense that we are not segmented to being a large dairy processing facility, nor small; rather our company falls right in the middle between these two. We are proud to say that, because of this, we are able to fill the gap for the customers who are being overlooked because of their size. Being able to fill this gap has given us a unique opportunity to be successful.</p>
